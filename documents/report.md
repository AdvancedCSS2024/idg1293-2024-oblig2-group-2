First we decided on a poster.

We then decided on which elements we should animate (the people having their arms move, the car moving in a wave motion, the stars shrinking and growing, the "pollution" clouds shrinking and growing again while moving up and down slightly.)

What class name we should give the different elements.

When we have done that, extract elements from the poster. Add those into the HTML as SVGs.

Implement class names.

And then style things in CSS (transfer the styling from HTML to CSS).

After that, we should make sure scalability works, then implement the animations.
